 Treehouse Code Adventures: JavaScript Calculator with a Dark Mode

This is my second Treehouse Code Adventure

Code Adventure Description:
Basic arithmetic operations should be functional: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The "AC" key should clear the current input and reset the calculator. The decimal point key should allow for calculations with decimal numbers. The equals key should compute the current calculation and display the result. The sun and moon icons are used to toggle between light and dark modes.

Extra Challenge: Add friendly custom validation messages to the form inputs.
